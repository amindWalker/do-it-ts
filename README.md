## â„¹ Note
* The main purpose of this project is to **document, evaluate and benchmark** the strong qualities of the `Rust` language by building a real-world FullStack `TypeScript` (BE+FE) application from scratch then reimplementing everything in `Rust`. I'm opensourcing a project that I've made back in 2020 using current (as of October 2022) tech and best practices from scratch because I want it to be scientifically fair for both sides. It could take a while to reimplement everything so stay tuned (:star: **star this repo if you like it**) and follow me on this huge endeavor.
* The expected result from this:
    > - [ ] `Rust` + `WebAssembly` provides faster, secure and predictable behavior (at compile-time) applications[^1].
    > - [ ] Better maintainable codebase in the medium or long-term.[^2]
    > - [ ] Front-end and back-end in `Rust` keeps high level abstractions with readable modern functional programming concepts that are comparable or better than `TypeScript`.[^3]
    > - [ ] Smaller cross-platform bundles (binaries + dependencies).[^4]
    > - [ ] Less memory and CPU usage (saving money and time).[^5]
    > - [x] First-class Tests, Documentation and Packaging (less dependencies).[^6]
    > - [x] Best-in-class compiler messages with inline manuals integrated with your IDE of choice.[^7]
