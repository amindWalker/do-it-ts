## â„¹ Note
* The main purpose of this project is to document, evaluate and benchmark the strong qualities of the Rust language by building a real-world FullStack TypeScript (BE+FE) application from scratch then reimplementing everything in Rust. The expected result is that Rust + WebAssembly will provide a faster, secure and better maintainable codebase in the medium or long-term.
